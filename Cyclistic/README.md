## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to leverage data-driven decision-making to improve customer satisfaction, increase revenue, and ultimately contribute to the success of Cyclistic. By analyzing customer data, we aim to answer critical questions about customer bike usage patterns, preferences, and factors that influence usage.

## Key Contributions

Our project involved the following key contributions:

1. **Data Analysis**: We analyzed Cyclistic's primary dataset, NYC Citi Bike Trips, to extract meaningful insights about customer behavior. This included understanding starting and ending station locations, trip durations, seasonal trends, and the impact of weather on bike usage.

2. **Dashboard Creation**: We designed and developed a user-friendly dashboard to visualize the insights generated from the data analysis. The dashboard includes multiple interactive visualizations that provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of customer usage patterns.

3. **Accessibility Features**: We ensured that the dashboard is accessible to all users by implementing options for large print and text-to-speech alternatives, aligning with accessibility best practices.

## Success Criteria

The success of this project is measured against the following criteria:

- Achieving a 90% accuracy rate in the predictive model for customer usage patterns.
- Increasing the customer base by 15% within the next year.
- Delivering the dashboard within the specified 6-week timeline.
- Receiving positive feedback from stakeholders on the usability and effectiveness of the dashboard.

## User Journeys

### Current User Experience

Before the project, Cyclistic had limited access to customer data, relied on manual data analysis, and lacked data-driven decision-making processes. This resulted in suboptimal marketing strategies and product development efforts.

### Ideal Future Experience

After the project, Cyclistic's teams have seamless access to actionable insights through the dashboard. This empowers data-driven decision-making in marketing, product development, and other departments, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and business growth.
